I have had the pleasure of working closely with PhD students and undergraduate students. Graduate students with solid theoretical background could check out this research opportunity [Deep-learning Enhanced Healthcare Modeling and Optimization](https://web.ics.purdue.edu/~shi178/Deep%20learning%20project.pdf). Purdue undergraduate students are encouraged to apply through my [DURI project](https://www.purdue.edu/discoverypark/duri/projects/index.php).
