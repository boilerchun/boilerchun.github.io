<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

I am an Associate Professor of [Operations Management](https://business.purdue.edu/academics/Operations/) at the Mitchell E. Daniels, Jr. School of Business, Purdue University. I am an affiliate faculty of the [Regenstrief Center for Healthcare Engineering](https://www.purdue.edu/research/rche/) and the [Integrative Data Science Initiative](https://datamine.purdue.edu).

I have had the pleasure of working closely with PhD students and undergraduate students; see my [Team](https://boilerchun.github.io/people/). Graduate students with solid theoretical background could check out this research opportunity [Deep-learning Enhanced Healthcare Modeling and Optimization](https://web.ics.purdue.edu/~shi178/Deep%20learning%20project.pdf). Purdue undergraduate students are encouraged to apply through my [DURI project](https://www.purdue.edu/discoverypark/duri/projects/index.php).

Here are links to my [CV](https://web.ics.purdue.edu/~shi178/Pengyi%20Shi_CV_Sep2023.pdf), [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=8xJkl2cAAAAJ&hl=en), [Personal Website](https://web.ics.purdue.edu/~shi178/).
