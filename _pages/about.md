I am an Associate Professor of [Operations Management](https://business.purdue.edu/academics/Operations/) at the Mitchell E. Daniels, Jr. School of Business, Purdue University. I am an affiliate faculty of the [Regenstrief Center for Healthcare Engineering](https://www.purdue.edu/research/rche/) and the [Integrative Data Science Initiative](https://datamine.purdue.edu).

I obtained my Ph.D. degree from the School of [Industrial and Systems Engineering](https://www.isye.gatech.edu/) at Georgia Institute of Technology in December 2013. I received my B.Eng. in Applied Mathematics and Mechanics and B.A. in Economics (double major) from [Peking University](http://english.pku.edu.cn/), China, in June 2007. My Ph.D. advisors are [Jim Dai](https://people.orie.cornell.edu/jdai/) and [Pinar Keskinocak](https://www.isye.gatech.edu/users/pinar-keskinocak). Here is a copy of my [Ph.D. thesis](https://web.ics.purdue.edu/~shi178/Pengyi_Shi_phd_thesis.pdf).

Here is a copy of my [CV](https://web.ics.purdue.edu/~shi178/Pengyi%20Shi_CV_Sep2023.pdf) and a link to my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=8xJkl2cAAAAJ&hl=en).

My research focuses on building data-driven, high fidelity models and developing predictive and prescriptive analytics to support decisions making under uncertainty in healthcare and service systems.

One of my main research stream is to develop **patient flow models** to improve hospital operations and patient outcomes. This stream of research has been implmeneted as tools for supporting inpatient discharge management and for supporting COVID-19 response in the hospital systems in Indiana. Recently, I have started working on developing predictive and operations tool for **criminal justice** system and its interface with **substance use abuse**.

My research methodologies include **stochastic models, queueing theory, Markov decision process, machine learning, and reinforcement learning**. See my publications and [here](https://web.ics.purdue.edu/~shi178/RL%20Guest%20Lecture.pdf) for a guest lecture I gave on applying reinforcement learning to tackle large-scale decision problems in hospital operations and criminal justice system. I am currently serving as an Associate Editor of Operations Research, Health Care Management Science, Service Science, and guest AE for MSOM, Naval Research Logistics.

I strive to develop high impact research and tackle real-world problems. I have been collaborating with practitioners and faculty members from different healthcare organizations, public sectors, and goverment agencies, publishing on medical journals. I was selected into the first cohort of Purdue Societal Impact fellows. As the PI, I received the [2021 and 2023 Engaged Scholarship Research/Creative Activities Grants](https://engagementscholarship.org/grants-and-awards/esc-grants-program/recipients) and the [2022 Shah Lab Global Innovation Lab Seed Grant](https://www.purdue.edu/provost/about/newsletter/jun2022/story-seven.php). I have worked extensively with large-scale data sets from hospitals and public sector organizations in the US, Singapore, and China. 

I have had the pleasure of working closely with PhD students and undergraduate students; see my research team. Graduate students with solid theoretical background could check out this research opportunity [Deep-learning Enhanced Healthcare Modeling and Optimization](https://web.ics.purdue.edu/~shi178/Deep%20learning%20project.pdf). Purdue undergraduate students are encouraged to apply through my [DURI project](https://www.purdue.edu/discoverypark/duri/projects/index.php).
