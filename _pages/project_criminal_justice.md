**Stopping the Revolving Door: MDP-Based Decision Support for Community Corrections Placement**
Authors: <ins>X. Gao</ins>, **P. Shi**, N. Kong [[Abstract and full paper]](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4672337)

Jail overcrowding is a pressing issue within the U.S. corrections system, with recidivism playing a key role in exacerbating this problem. In response, incarceration-diversion programs like community corrections (CC) have gained attention for their potential to break this cycle by offering treatment and reintegration services. However, sending all eligible individuals to CC without proper consideration can merely transfer overcrowding from jail to CC, potentially leading to adverse outcomes. Our research addresses the urgent need for analytics-informed decision support to identify suitable CC candidates while accounting for relevant factors.

In this paper, we employ system engineering, queueing theory, and Markov decision process to develop the first-known model that captures the intricate process flow and essential tradeoffs among overcrowding and reoffending in the incarceration-diversion process. Our model accounts for deterministic service times, deviating from traditional memoryless queueing systems to capture sentence lengths as determined by judges. We propose a novel theoretical framework to tackle the analytical challenges posed by this feature. Additionally, we have developed a scalable and interpretable decision support that maximizes societal benefits while avoiding unintended consequences arising from overlooking system-level impacts.

Through a fruitful collaboration with our community partner, [TCCC](https://www.tippecanoe.in.gov/434/Community-Corrections), we illustrate the effectiveness of our solution through counterfactual studies calibrated with real data. Our approach demonstrates the potential to reduce the 3-year recidivism rate by 28% with current staffing and up to 48% with the addition of four more case managers. Importantly, the capacity planning recommendations generated by our research have been adopted by our community partner in recent budget justifications presented during townhall meetings. This tangible impact underscores the relevance and significance of our work, which has the potential to guide resource allocation decisions that affect individuals involved in community corrections and address critical issues such as recidivism and overcrowding.  

While this paper presents an important step forward in understanding and optimizing placement decisions in the community corrections setting, we acknowledge that the criminal justice system is inherently complex and multi-faceted, involving various legal, social, and individual factors that cannot be fully captured in any mathematical model. Our decision-support framework should be seen as a tool to facilitate better-informed decisions beyond the traditional siloed thinking and offers an alternative perspective to advocates of jail capacity expansion.

Incarceration-diversion programs have proven effective in reducing recidivism. Accurate prediction of the number of individuals with different characteristics in the program and their program outcomes based on given eligibility criteria is crucial for successful implementation, because this prediction serves as the foundation for determining the appropriate program size and the consequent staffing requirements. However, this task poses challenges due to the complexities arising from varied outcomes and lengths-of-stay for the diverse individuals in incarceration-diversion programs. In collaboration with an Illinois government agency, we develop a framework to address these issues. Our framework combines ML and queueing model simulation, providing accurate predictions for the program census and interpretable insights into pro- gram dynamics and the impact of different decisions in counterfactual scenarios. Additionally, we deploy a user-friendly web app beta-version that allows program managers to visualize census data by counties and race groups. We showcase two decision support use cases: changing program admission criteria and launching similar programs in new counties.
